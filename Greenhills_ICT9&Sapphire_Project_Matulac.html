       <h1 style="font-size:20px;color: black; font-family: Comfortaa;text-align: center;"> Fire safety awareness means analyzing the possible risks of fire in your vicinity and taking preventive measures to ensure minimum damage <br> and safe exit of all the person exposed to fire. Different fire safety awareness approaches are adopted at different locations. However, the <br> priority of every approach is the safe and successful evacuation of people trapped in a building in case of a fire. For efficient <br>fire safety awareness, proper fire safety training is crucial. A professional fire safety training program involves the necessary steps one must undertake  <br> in the event of a fire. Well planned and practiced fire safety training can prepare you mentally and physically to keep your mind calm during an 
       <br> emergency situation so that you can take the necessary steps to mitigate the damage. </h1>
